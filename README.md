# Riccardo Cutruneo
Full-stack Web Developer with passion for trying out new technologies, breaking code and videogames.

Since I was young, I've always had a strong sense of curiosity about the world, constantly asking myself "why" about everything. This sparked in me a deep desire to be eclectic in any field that piqued my interest, with computer science being the first.

I discovered that, with specific and thoughtful input, it was possible to "talk" to computers and tell them exactly what to do, which led me to the world of programming languages.

I enjoy having a personalized workflow that fits my needs, making what I do even more stimulating and less laborious. ðŸ’»âœ¨
